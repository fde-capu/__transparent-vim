# __transparent-vim

A Vim color scheme transformer to set transparent background.

### Tired of ugly backgrounds clashing with your translucent preference?

This program, `__transparent`, lets you enjoy your favorite themes on a transparent background – perfect for terminal emulators that support it. Simply run `:colo __transparent` after loading your theme. This keeps your theme's colors intact while making the background disappear.
